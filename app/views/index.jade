      h1 Relationship-Based
      p Unique in the world of technology, Digital Coaching Network is a business about relationships. These are not just transactional relationships, but personal relationships that honor the inner world of everyone involved.

      h2 Client 
        span.smaller-chr ⟷ 
        | Coach
      p The coach's #1 job with you, the client, is to listen. They listen so they may understand where you are coming from, what your struggles are, and what you would like to learn. Coaches' communications include not only information, but also contextual and emotional content that is appropriate to each moment.

      h2 Coach 
        span.smaller-chr ⟷ 
        | Founder
      p Coaches and founders recognize the importance of relationship in their communications with each other. Maintaining and supporting positive relationships within the company takes precedence over other business outcomes.

      h2 Client 
        span.smaller-chr ⟷ 
        | Technology
      p Even the content itself is about relationship: your relationship with technology and the tools you use in your personal life or business. We recognize that learning specific skills are meaningless if broader dynamics of process and subjective experience are ignored.
